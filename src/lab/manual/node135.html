Firstly, I (Pratik Behera)would like to thank Prof Moudgalya Kannan, for giving me this opportunity to undertake MPC project on SBHS. This project, which involved implementing Model Predictive Control in SBHS using SCILAB, was very interesting and provided an excellent learning opportunity. For developing the MPC algorithm, lecture notes on Model Predictive Control by Prof. Sachin Patwardhan too were extremely helpful. Also, I got to learn a lot from the speaking tutorials of SCILAB and LaTeX, which had to be referred to for the completion of this project. Over and above this, it was very encouraging to see the experiments working perfectly with the developed Model Predictive Control algorithm.
I would also like to sincerely thank Mr Prashant Gupta, without whom, this project would not have been splendidly completed. I would like to thank him for the time he spent explaining the concepts, clearing the doubts and suggestions for the experiments to implement MPC.
